# Telsa-Price-Volume-to-tweets
For my project, I decided to analyze the change in stock price of Tesla (TSLA) on days where Elon Musk posted a tweet on Twitter, to the actual number of tweets Elon Musk puts out. My datasets were all derived using Kaggle and are named “TSLA.csv” and “TweetsElonMusk.csv”. The first dataset contains information on the Tesla stock, and the latter contains data on tweets by Elon Musk. Originally was trying to see if there was a correlation between Tesla Price and Tweets. That being said, I was also able to determine there is a very strong relationship between the number of tweets Elon Musk puts out, and the volume that Tesla stock is traded.
